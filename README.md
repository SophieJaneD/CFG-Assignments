 In this assignment I will be using Github to upload my project for my tutor, Frederick to mark.

# Git Ignore

A .gitignore file dictates which files or directories it should ignore and not track. This has a few applications:

- Hiding sensitive or private information

- Excluding large or irrelevant files
